Flamework
=========

Flamework is the semi-fictional framework that powers Flickr.com.
It's less of an actual framework and more of a design philosophy.
None of the code in this project is actually taken from Flickr,
but is rather a reconstruction of the way we built things there and
the way we continue to build things now.


Installation
------------

Copy everything to a web server running Apache with <code>mod_php</code>.
Enable <code>AllowOverrides all</code> for the root.
Edit <code>include/config.php</code>.
That might be it.
